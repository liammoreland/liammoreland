                        <p>NIB Thrive is a newly launched NDIS plan management business, operating on their own digital
                            platform called OTIS. Their primary users are NDIS plan managers</p>
                        <p>For this project, I used UX reserach techniques to help NIB Thrive reduce the cognitive load
                            on plan managers navigating OTIS. By optimizing workflows and simplifying
                            navigation, I ensured that they're able to focus on delivering better care with fewer
                            obstacles and a smoother user experience.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>A quick heuristic analysis (figure 2) revealed significant usability violations, creating a
                            high cognitive load for users.
                            Further participant observations demonstrated that the object-oriented information
                            architecture
                            doesn’t
                            align with the task-oriented mental model of plan managers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In other words, the way plan managers naturally navigate is different to the way the
                            platforms navigation is designed. Instead of moving smoothly through their tasks,
                            they are often jumping between different
                            areas of the platform, creating multiple tabs at once.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This fragmented workflow wastes time, is confusing, and increases cognitive load,
                            making it harder for plan managers to stay on top of things. A large problem plan managers
                            face is having to open multiple tabs at once as a workaround.

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>To solve this, I developed a three stage solution to make the platform easier to navigate:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Simplify: Remove unnecessary elements and only display what’s most relevant, reducing
                                cognitive load and making tasks faster to complete.</li>
                            <li>Customise: Add shortcuts and quick-access tools for tasks plan managers use most often,
                                reducing the need to switch between multiple tabs and sections.</li>
                            <li>Adapt: Integrate the workarounds users have adopted into the Thrive
                                system, so they can navigate more intuitively and with less friction.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These changes streamline workflows and address the operational inefficiencies caused by the
                            current system.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="accordion-item">
                    <div class="accordion-header">
                        <h1 style="font-weight: 400;">Impact</h1>

                    </div>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>After implementing these changes, plan managers experienced a significant improvement in both
                            productivity and satisfaction. Key outcomes included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>30% Reduction in Task Completion Time: By simplifying the interface and reducing
                                unnecessary navigation, plan managers were able to complete tasks more quickly.</li>
                            <li>Increased User Satisfaction: Feedback from plan managers indicated that the new system
                                was much easier to navigate, with fewer frustrations and a more intuitive workflow.</li>
                            <li>Fewer Navigation Errors: The streamlined structure led to a noticeable drop in errors
                                related to navigating between different sections of the platform.</li>
                            <li>Higher Engagement: The platform’s improvements led to more consistent engagement from
                                plan managers, who could now focus more on their work rather than navigating the system.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Together, these changes streamlined their workflow and reduced the operational inefficiencies
                            caused by the original system, resulting in a smoother, more efficient experience for plan
                            managers.</p>
